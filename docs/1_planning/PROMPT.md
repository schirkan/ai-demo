Context: A feature has been moved into the planning stage and the idea file 
has been referenced using @filename.md in this chat.

Instructions:

Read the Referenced File: Review the contents of the feature file that was 
referenced using @ (e.g., @chart-feature.md) to understand the feature idea 
and its intended goal.

Determine Feature Name: Extract a short, clear name for the feature based 
on the file or content (e.g., chart-feature.md → “Chart Feature”).

Create Folder: Inside docs/1_planning/, create a new folder named after the 
feature (e.g., docs/1_planning/chart-feature/).

Create Standard Files: Within this folder, generate the following files:

- README.md
- spec.md
- design.md

Populate README.md:

- Extract and include the Goal of the feature.
- Populate the following sections using your best judgement based on the 
file contents:

Key Requirements — List the core functional or technical requirements implied 
or stated in the idea.

Target Audience — Define who this feature is for (e.g., developers, analysts, 
end users).

Open Questions — List any specific clarifying questions that would need to be 
answered if you have them and if things are still confusing.

Populate spec.md:

- Outline the feature’s intended functionality and technical scope.
- Include 2–3 different UI treatments or layout options for how this feature 
could be visually presented or interacted with in the product 
(e.g., tabs vs. dropdown, modal vs. sidebar, chart styles, etc.).

- Highlight trade-offs or use cases that might make one design better than 
another.

Populate design.md:

Add any architectural thoughts, visual sketches (as markdown code or descriptions), 
component interactions, or other design considerations worth capturing early.
