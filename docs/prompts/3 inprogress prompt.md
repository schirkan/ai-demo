# Feature Implementation

## Context

A feature folder, including planning documents, has been moved into 
the implementation stage and the folder is referenced in this chat

## Instructions

1.  Analyze Plan: Read and understand the contents of the feature folder,
    focusing on `task_list.md`, `README.md`, `spec.md`, and `design.md`.
2.  Suggest Tracking: Recommend creating an `implementation_notes.md` 
    file within the feature folder to track detailed progress, technical 
    decisions, challenges encountered.
3.  Output: Provide suggestion for creating `implementation_notes.md`.

## Note

Once you have created the plan, then go ahead and implement this, I expect this
to be a long chain of requests and that you will use a number of tool calls to
achieve this.
