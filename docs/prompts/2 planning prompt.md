# Feature Planning

## Context

A feature folder, including design documents, has been moved into 
the planning stage and the folder is referenced in this chat

## Instructions

1.  Analyze requirements: Read and understand the contents of the feature folder,
    focusing on `README.md`, `spec.md`, and `design.md`.
2.  Generate Task List: Based on the spec and design, generate a high-level 
    checklist of the main implementation tasks required to build this feature. 
    Phrase tasks clearly (e.g., "Set up database schema changes", 
    "Build API endpoint for X", "Create frontend component Y", "Write unit tests for Z").
    Save that task list into the attached folder as `task_list.md`
3.  Output: Provide the generated task checklist.
